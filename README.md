The program will open a window that allows the webcam to take the picture of the person in front of the screen and will then perform analysis on the type of emotion he/she experiences


Dataset:
We have used the fer2013/fer2013/ dataset available in the source code.

-fer2013 emotion classification test accuracy: 33%
